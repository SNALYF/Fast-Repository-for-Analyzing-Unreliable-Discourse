**Feature Explanation**
The query builder is the main feature of the search page, where it returns the searched results in the middle of the page so that the user can easily view the results. Aside from search-related features, we also have other features such as corpora information, statistics, and about page, these pages provides a more thothrough understanding of the corpora to users. In the mean time, since we have two different corpora, Chinese and English, we need to have a way to distinguish between them, so we have a corpora selection feature that allows users to switch between the two corpora.

**Web Server Deployment**
 - Render: https://render.com/
    - A Platform as a Service provider that allows users to deploy web applications and services, based on the scale of our project, Render provides free tier for us to deploy our web application with FastAPI and Python Backend.
 - AWS: https://aws.amazon.com/
    - A cloud computing platform that provides a wide range of services, based on the scale of our project, AWS provides free tier for us to deploy our web application with FastAPI and Python Backend.
    - A good practice for us to learn how to deploy web applications and services in the cloud.

**Data Storage**
 - Amazon S3 and Local Woosh Indexing: Our dataset is not that large, so we can store the dataset in Amazon S3 and use local Woosh Indexing for the search functionality. Amazon provides 5 GB of free storage for us to use.

**Future Improvements**
 - Docker Image: We can use Docker Image to package our web application and its dependencies, so that it can be deployed in any environment.
 - IAA Match Integration: Users can annotate existing documents online and compare their annotations with the annotations of other users, return the IAA alpha scores to users.
